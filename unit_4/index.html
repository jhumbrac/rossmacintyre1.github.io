		<h2>About</h2>
		<h3>We're increasing digital in an omni-channel world</h3>
		<p>I’m deeply fascinated by a world where the on and offline environments have irreversibly collapsed into one, and technology is increasingly integrating into our everyday lives. It is best described as the omni-channel environment, because it’s an all-encompassing place that the user does not think about consciously. Users interchangeably move from the real to the virtual world without hesitation, seamlessly. Companies are recognising this, however it is simply the pace at which they are shifting behaviours and attitudes that are resulting in companies being left behind. New devices, software updates, another social media platform, it is a constant macro demand to provide more convenience, speed and control, and users will gravitate towards the brands that deliver in these areas. With years of experience at a pan-european branding agency, and heading the digital department, I am excellently placed to support companies with digital services that puts the user at the heart of the experience, whilst achieving results that delivers success. Understanding the full user journey, and not simply digital in isolation, means that the on and offline experiences can fit ‘hand in glove’, and meet their expectations.</p>

			<h3>FMCG</h3>
			<p>Understanding the user behaviour, and their triggers and barriers to conversion, opens opportunities to thrive in a highly fragmented world. Refining my digital strategy and shopper marketing skills for global companies including P&G, Reckitt Benckiser, United Biscuits and Dr.Oetker, I have expertise in digital services that provides the presence that companies and brands require.</p>

			<h3>Start ups</h3>
			<p>There is nothing more rewarding than supporting a start up to market. It’s fast, energetic and uncovers builds and learnings that changes marketing activities instantly. Supporting companies such as the fancy dress supplier, Morphsuits, from just an idea to a million pound enterprise, illustrates the agility and flexibility required for business acceleration.</p>

			<h3>Agency</h3>
			<p>The demands are constant and the rewards are fulfilling. Thriving in an environment where combining speed, competence and expertise is the surefire way in helping clients achieve their goals. With 7 years agency experience, of which 3 years were heading the digital department, I know what it takes to deliver strategy, team management and project delivery.</p>
